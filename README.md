# Optimizing Battery Life with the Flutter Power Management Plugin

## Introduction

Efficient battery usage is crucial for a positive user experience on Android devices. However, some Android phones can be overly aggressive in managing background processes, leading to poor app performance and missed notifications. This Flutter plugin addresses this issue by preventing your app from being prematurely killed in the background.

## Plugin Overview

The purpose of this plugin is to safeguard your app from being terminated by aggressive power management policies on certain Android devices. By integrating this plugin into your Flutter project, you can ensure that your app continues to run smoothly and deliver notifications without interruptions.

## How to Use

Follow these steps to integrate the Flutter Power Management Plugin into your project:

1.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone the plugin repository into your project's `lib` folder using the following command:
    
   ```bash
    
    `git clone https://github.com/furkanansn/flutter_power_management_dont_kill_my_app_plugin.git` 
 ```
2.  **Update `pubspec.yaml`:** In your project's `pubspec.yaml` file, add the plugin dependency. Modify the `dependencies` section as shown below, replacing `<project path here>` with the actual path to the plugin in your project.
    
    ```yaml
    
    `dependencies:
      flutter:
        sdk: flutter
      power_management:
        path: /<project path here>/power_management # Example: path: /Users/admin/Documents/YourApp/power_management` 
    ```
3.  **Import the Package:** Import the package into your Dart file where you want to use it.
    
    dartCopy code
    
    `import 'package:power_management/power_management.dart';` 
    
4.  **Integrate into `initState`:** Invoke the power-saving feature in the `initState` method of your widget. This ensures that the power management optimization takes place early in the app lifecycle.
    
    ```dart
    
    `@override
    void initState() {
      Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 0), () async {
        await PowerManagement.powerSaving;
      });
      super.initState();
    }` 
    ```
5.  **Enjoy Improved Performance:** With the Flutter Power Management Plugin integrated into your project, you can now enjoy enhanced app performance and prevent background termination issues.
