Perfect Readme for Network Operations Classes
Overview
This repository provides a set of classes to simplify and optimize your network operations. The classes are designed with an object-oriented layer architecture, offering a seamless way to modify headers with minimal code. Integrating these classes into your project enhances code organization and facilitates efficient network-related tasks.

Key Features
Object-Oriented Architecture: Utilize an object-oriented programming (OOP) layer for effortless header modification. This approach minimizes code complexity and enhances the overall maintainability and readability of your code.
How to Use
Example
```dart

// Import the necessary classes
import 'path_to_base_network.dart'; // Replace with the actual import path
import 'path_to_local_util.dart';   // Replace with the actual import path

// Create a class using the provided base network and local utility
class ListService extends BaseNetwork with ILocalUtil {

  // Define a method to retrieve a list of MyModel objects for the month
  Future<List<MyModel>> getMonthList() async {
    // Make a network request using the 'request' method
    final response = await request(
        url: "api/list/getMonths",
        token: await getLocalData(key: "token"),
        requestType: "Get");
        
    // Convert the response to a list of MyModel objects
    return (response as List)
        .map((e) => MyModel.fromJson(e))
        .toList();
  }

}
```
Ensure you replace 'path_to_base_network.dart' and 'path_to_local_util.dart' with the actual paths to the base network and local utility classes in your project.

Feel free to customize the getMonthList method to suit your specific use case. This example serves as a template for making network requests and handling responses efficiently.
