Overview
This set of classes is designed to streamline your network operations, providing an object-oriented layer architecture for efficient header modification with minimal code. By incorporating these classes into your project, you can enhance the organization and simplicity of your network-related tasks.

Key Features
Object-Oriented Architecture: These classes follow an object-oriented programming (OOP) approach, facilitating easy modification of headers with minimal code. The modular design enhances code maintainability and readability.
How to Use
```dart
// Import the necessary classes
import 'path_to_base_network.dart'; // Ensure correct import path
import 'path_to_local_util.dart';   // Ensure correct import path

// Create a class using the provided base network and local utility
class ListService extends BaseNetwork with ILocalUtil {

  // Define a method to retrieve a list of MyModel objects for the month
  Future<List<MyModel>> getMonthList() async {
    // Make a network request using the 'request' method
    final response = await request(
        url: "api/list/getMonths",
        token: await getLocalData(key: "token"),
        requestType: "Get");
        
    // Convert the response to a list of MyModel objects
    return (response as List)
        .map((e) => MyModel.fromJson(e))
        .toList();
  }

}
```

Ensure you replace 'path_to_base_network.dart' and 'path_to_local_util.dart' with the actual paths to the base network and local utility classes in your project.

Feel free to customize the getMonthList method and adapt it to your specific use case. The provided example serves as a template for making network requests and handling responses efficiently.
